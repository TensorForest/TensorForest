## üîß Development Process  

### **Key Features**  
- **LiDAR Integration**: TensorForest now includes LiDAR technology to map **tree canopy heights**, enabling more detailed vegetation analysis.  
- **Flammability Mapping**: Custom machine learning models assess vegetation types and flammability levels to predict wildfire risks.  
- **NDVI Data Mapping**: Utilizing a **GoPro 7 with a Backbone mod** to capture full-spectrum imagery and generate NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data for vegetation health analysis.  
- **Real-Time Insights**: Drone-collected data is processed to generate actionable wildfire prevention strategies.

### **Challenges We Overcame**  
1. **Hardware Integration**: Ensuring seamless compatibility between flight controllers, LiDAR sensors, GPS modules, and camera systems.  
2. **Software Complexity**: Developing machine learning models, flight planning algorithms, and image processing scripts.  
3. **Field Testing**: Managing logistical and safety challenges during real-world drone testing in forest environments.

### **Key Technologies**  
- **Drone Hardware**: Built using a lightweight, prebuilt carbon fiber kit with custom components for optimal performance.  
- **LiDAR Technology**: Provides precise tree canopy height mapping for detailed vegetation analysis.  
- **Full-Spectrum Imaging**: Captured with a modified GoPro 7 to generate NDVI data for vegetation health mapping.  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow models trained to classify vegetation and analyze wildfire risk factors.  
- **Open-Source Software**: Leveraging ArduPilot for autonomous drone navigation and TensorFlow Lite for object detection.
